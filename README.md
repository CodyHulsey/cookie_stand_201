During this assignment I completed the following:
- Created my first render function
- Utilized the generate random number
- Created a table that lists projected cookie sales during the day based on the properties/keys
- Once I built the render function, I created a stores array that utilized the for loop function and in the end documented the cookie sales for five stores
